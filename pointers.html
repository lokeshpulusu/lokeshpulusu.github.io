 <p>
  1.what is a pointer.</br></br>
A)it is a holder.</br></br>
it can hold the address.</b</br>r>
A pointer is really just a varia</br>ble that contains an adress.</br>
pointer just like any other variable it has type! means, a pointer can 
be integer pointer or float pointer.(It has to hold an address, but, adress of some type
of variable.</br>
2.what is the size of an pointer?what is the size of an integer pointer,
float pointer and character pointer.</br>
A)</br>
it is a holder to hold the address. size of the pointer is consistent for any data type</br>
it varies with architecture.</br>
4 bytes for 32 bit architecture.</br>
8 bytes for 32 bit architecture.</br>

3. What is a NULL Pointer?</br>

A NULL pointer is a special pointer that points nowhere. That is no other pointer will be 
equal to NULL Pointer.</br>
The most peasier and straight forward way to get a NULL pointer in your program is use to 
the predefined constant NULL, which is defined by several standard header files including 
<stdio.h> <stdlib.h> and <string.h></br>

//NULL Pointer</br>

#include<stdio.h> </br>
int main()</br>
{</br>
int*p;</br>
p=NULL;</br>
printf("\n the value of P is %u,p);</br>
return 0;</br>
</br>}</br>
</br>
o/p: </br>
the val</br>ue of P is 0</br>

we can assign in these ways as well!</br>
Int *ip=NULL;</br>
int *ip=0;</br>

4. what is a void pointer? what is its limitation?</br>
A)</br>
</br>
A void pointer is a special type of pointer.</br>
it can poi</br>nt to any datatype, from an integer value to float to anything!
its sole limitation is that it can be referenced directly. (* cannot be used on them as the 
length is alwa</br>ys un determined).</br>
Therefore type casting is required must be used to turn the void pointer to a pointer of a 
concrete data type</br> to which we can refer. An example would be helpful.</br>

#include<stdio.h></br>
int main()</br>
{</br>
int a=5;</br>
double b=3.233;</br>
void *vp;//void pointer</br>
vp=&a;</br>
printf("\n b=%f",*((int*)vp);</br>
vp=&b;</br>
printf("\n b=%f",*((double*)vp);</br>
return 0;</br>
}</br>
O/P</br>
</br>
a=5</br>
b3.233000;</br>
 </p></br>
