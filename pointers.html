 <p>
  1.what is a pointer.
A)it is a holder.
it can hold the address.
A pointer is really just a variable that contains an adress.
pointer just like any other variable it has type! means, a pointer can 
be integer pointer or float pointer.(It has to hold an address, but, adress of some type
of variable.
2.what is the size of an pointer?what is the size of an integer pointer,
float pointer and character pointer.
A)
it is a holder to hold the address. size of the pointer is consistent for any data type
it varies with architecture.
4 bytes for 32 bit architecture.
8 bytes for 32 bit architecture.

3. What is a NULL Pointer?

A NULL pointer is a special pointer that points nowhere. That is no other pointer will be 
equal to NULL Pointer.
The most peasier and straight forward way to get a NULL pointer in your program is use to 
the predefined constant NULL, which is defined by several standard header files including 
<stdio.h> <stdlib.h> and <string.h>

//NULL Pointer

#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
int*p;
p=NULL;
printf("\n the value of P is %u,p);
return 0;
}

o/p: 
the value of P is 0

we can assign in these ways as well!
Int *ip=NULL;
int *ip=0;

4. what is a void pointer? what is its limitation?
A)

A void pointer is a special type of pointer.
it can point to any datatype, from an integer value to float to anything!
its sole limitation is that it can be referenced directly. (* cannot be used on them as the 
length is always un determined).
Therefore type casting is required must be used to turn the void pointer to a pointer of a 
concrete data type to which we can refer. An example would be helpful.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a=5;
double b=3.233;
void *vp;//void pointer
vp=&a;
printf("\n b=%f",*((int*)vp);
vp=&b;
printf("\n b=%f",*((double*)vp);
return 0;
}
O/P

a=5
b3.233000;
 </p>
